# visual-music
This is a program that explores pitch constellations, searching for a visual translation of music. 

Choc plays a midi file and assigns a coloured dot for every note. It distinguishes two channels, with two corresponding concentric circles.

Midi5 uses the same concept, in this case the input is via midi controller, and lines are drawn to highlight chords.

It's in early development, I have no programming skills, this is being done with the help of LLMs. There are different paths this could lead to, I feel it could offer interesting solutions for music educators. I hope that publishing it here I can generate interest in knowledgeable people that share this view.
